iPhone_Bands
============

This is a complete iPhone App project called "Bands". 

It is from the book "iOS Programmming" by Nick Harris (2014), ISBN 978-1-118-84147-1.

It allows the user to store favorite bands in an alphabeta list. The user can share bands information by email or message, search the web, find local record stores (and locate them on google map), search iTunes for tracks and play the preview tracks. The function is versatile.

The code is assembled from the book, with minor changes to fix certain issues and make it work properly. Finished in June/July of 2014.

OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, XCode 5.
