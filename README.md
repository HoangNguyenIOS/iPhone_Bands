iPhone_Bands
============

This is a complete iPhone App project called "Bands", from book "iOS Programmming".

This Bands App project is from the book "iOS Programming" by Nick Harris (2014), ISBN 978-1-118-84147-1.

It allows the user to store favorite bands in alphabeta list. Can share bands information by email or message, search the web, find local record stores (and locate them on google map), search iTunes for tracks and play the preview tracks. The function is versatile.

The code is entirely from the book, with minor change and adjustments to fix issues and make it work properly. Finished in June/July of 2014.
